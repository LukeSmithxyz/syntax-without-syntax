1. Be more explicit about the nature  of your input representation. For
example, what do you mean by S, V, and O. Are these syntactic, semantic,
what? Prima facie, your inputs seem to be syntactic objects, despite the
preceding prose, so please address this explicitly.

2. Be more careful in the initial framing language for the paper. In fact,
the safest thing might be to prune a lot of that back.

3. Make clear your assumptions about the how S, V, and O are stressed. Is
this a stipulation? Does this follow form something? There was particular
concern about O getting "strong" stress, so be sure to address this.

4. You need tableaux to justify each constraint as you introduce them.

5. There are several literatures that you need to respond to. This response
should come AFTER you present your own analysis and should definitely
include work on parallel architectures, e.g. autolexical syntax,
Fitzgerald's work, and Mike's work.
